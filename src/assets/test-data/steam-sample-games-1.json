Measure your devotion and your bravery by journeying into deepest darkness for answers to questions that will challenge your very existence.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/718590/extras/a-demanding-fight-to-the-death-ConvertImage.png?t=1556179957\" ><br><br>Dark Devotion features a richly detailed, immersive narrative that unfolds a sombre tale of your Templar religionâ€™s irresistible calling. Every encounter challenges your fortitude, piety, and conviction as you move deeper into your cursed pilgrimage. Spanning four unique worlds, each with their own incredibly detailed environments, youâ€™ll wield dozens of weapons in your quest to discover the Templeâ€™s secret: all the while assailed by dark enemies and devious bosses whose core mission is to destroy your soul and damn you forever.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/718590/extras/combat-1.gif?t=1556179957\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/718590/extras/Rooted_in_RPG_appeal.png?t=1556179957\" ><br><br>Throughout Dark Devotion youâ€™ll discover an array of weapons, armors, and relics with which to enhance your character. Each item has its own attributes and statistics, and is customizable with mystical runes. It is essential that you maximize your strengths and adapt your inventory to the enemy youâ€™re facing. Choose wisely...<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/718590/extras/Unravel_the_Temple_dark_purpose.png?t=1556179957\" ><br><br>Dark Devotion is a story of perseverance, dedication, and secrets. Every chest you open, every item you encounter holds another piece of the story: be it a letter, weapon, or clue, all will help you on your quest. Whether you find these secrets amongst the shadows or in the dead hand of another character ...well, that all depends.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/718590/extras/Salle-secrete.gif?t=1556179957\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/718590/extras/Seek_your_salvation.png?t=1556179957\" ><br><br>In the Temple, Faith is your only recourse against the heathen droves.

Your survival depends on using the right item at the right time to heal your wounds or dispel a curse. Some of these items can be looted, others are scattered throughout the Temple in secret places. Employ them wiselyâ€¦ your life depends on it.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/718590/extras/Only-the-deserving-will-find-virtue-in-the-Temple-ConvertImage_(1).png?t=1556179957\" ><br><br>The eye of your God is ever-watchful. Complete an act of bravery or skill, and your God might bless you. But the Temple is also rife with despair and sickness, ready to destroy those who lack courage and temperance.

Succeed and you will reap the rewards of a prestigious address where everyone will clamor to live and work.

But a skyscraper is more than just steel and glass, itâ€™s an intricate ecosystem, full of people that live and work in the building. They become a complex machine that needs your steady hand to keep it running smoothly and efficiently.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/423580/extras/header_residential-HR.jpg?t=1549048590\" ><br>From the moment you break ground, every decision rests with you. As the architect you must coordinate the construction of everything - every wall and wire, every office and apartment. As the building owner you must keep your tenants happy - and paying rent on time. As a savvy developer you must keep an eye on the bottom line and invest in the future. Succeed and you will reap the rewards of a prestigious address where everyone will clamor to live and work. Fail and you will watch tenants leave in disgust, taking their business elsewhere and leaving your reputation in tatters.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/423580/extras/header_restaurant-HR.jpg?t=1549048590\" ><br>Will you create an exclusive office highrise that attracts business leaders from around the world? Will you construct luxury apartments in the sky, penthouses for the elite and playgrounds for the famous?

They function as a sort of prerequisite or turning point for a story branch. In NTY!!! whenever one of these &quot;flags&quot; is triggered, the No, Thank You!!! Button will appear in the upper left-hand corner.<br><br><br>Essentially, the NTY!!! button is comparable to a two-option choice in function: you either click it and destroy the &quot;flag&quot; or ignore it and let it stand. The main difference is that you don't know what the options are exactly or what the question is (for that, you have to pay attention to the scene and figure out what you're being asked). The button will remain on-screen for several lines. You can click it as long as it is on screen, the precise timing has no effect. If you decide not to destroy the flag (and to not click the NTY!!! button), simply ignore it and continue reading. Sometimes not clicking it is the correct option.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>This long, yet fleeting, summer vacation begins with a car crash.<br><br>One day in June, as summer draws near, our protagonist protects a man from an out-of-control car, but gets hit and loses his memory in the process.<br>The man our protagonist saved feels responsible for him, having no identification on him or any obvious leads as to his identity, and gives him a job.<br><br>He brings him to a little bar on the outskirts of downtown called 'sÃ³tano'.<br>On the outside, it looks like a cozy little jazz bar, but it has another side to it.<br><br>They take on cases that the police and legitimate detective agencies won't touch.<br>The staff there give our protagonist the name 'Haru,' and he gradually makes his way deeper into the organization while working as an apprentice bartender.",

Creatura is a virtual aquarium/terrarium tank to manage and simulate evolution from the very ground up. Every plant and animal inside takes part in natural and artificial selection, creating unlimited possibilities in simulating or recreating unique environments and pets, while being scientifically accurate with up-to-date biology research and helping to understand Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel great discoveries with simple and captivating gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">At The Beginning, There Was (Mostly) Water.</h2>With empty vivarium tank at hand, start your journey to create thriving biomes using only time and artificial/natural selection mechanisms. Begin with single cyanobacteria to rush the botanical travel through algae, ferns, vines, grasses up to modern flowers and fruit trees, just by strategically taking plant cuttings, the same method agriculture used for last ten thousands of years. Every plant shape, colour and type is possibility, just wait for desired mutation to appear, take a clipping and plant it to create new and unique flora species. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/781130/extras/LivelyFrighteningBison-size_restricted.gif?t=1551582658\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">then, Wild Fish Appeared. </h2></h2></h2>While some multicellular organisms thrive using only sun for photosynthesis, other quickly evolve ability to cannibalize living entities for energy. Where access to sunlight is unlimited, the algae will conquer ecosystem, but in other places, deep below, within abundance of decomposing biological material, the mighty proto-sponge will start the process of eumetazoic evolution. With Your guidance and just right conditions, the sponge will slowly free itself from ground and start the millennial crawl towards complex lifeforms. From that point, it's up to You to create and grow environment providing food and safety for one specie, while simultaneously crafting hunting grounds for others.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">the Ape That Ate the Fish.</h2></h2></h2>After contemplating the cycle of life and beauty of it's creation - how about breaking it with science? Instead of waiting millennia for proper mutations randomly popping up, use in-game GCAT-DNA editor (based on state of art very real software used by modern scientists all over the world), sequence the genome, lookup DNA amino-acid groups on Wikipedia and play god... even more!

    "short_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Seed, Breed, Create.</h2> From single cell organisms to complex ecosystems. Creatura is a virtual aquarium/terrarium tank to manage and simulate evolution from the very ground up. Every plant and animal inside takes part in natural and artificial selection, creating unlimited possibilities in simulating or recreating unique environments and pets, while being scientifically accurate with up-to-date biology research and helping to understand Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel great discoveries with simple and captivating gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">At The Beginning, There Was (Mostly) Water.</h2>With empty vivarium tank at hand, start your journey to create thriving biomes using only time and artificial/natural selection mechanisms. Begin with single cyanobacteria to rush the botanical travel through algae, ferns, vines, grasses up to modern flowers and fruit trees, just by strategically taking plant cuttings, the same method agriculture used for last ten thousands of years. Every plant shape, colour and type is possibility, just wait for desired mutation to appear, take a clipping and plant it to create new and unique flora species. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/781130/extras/LivelyFrighteningBison-size_restricted.gif?t=1551582658\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">then, Wild Fish Appeared. </h2></h2></h2>While some multicellular organisms thrive using only sun for photosynthesis, other quickly evolve ability to cannibalize living entities for energy. Where access to sunlight is unlimited, the algae will conquer ecosystem, but in other places, deep below, within abundance of decomposing biological material, the mighty proto-sponge will start the process of eumetazoic evolution. With Your guidance and just right conditions, the sponge will slowly free itself from ground and start the millennial crawl towards complex lifeforms. From that point, it's up to You to create and grow environment providing food and safety for one specie, while simultaneously crafting hunting grounds for others.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">the Ape That Ate the Fish.</h2></h2></h2>After contemplating the cycle of life and beauty of it's creation - how about breaking it with science? Instead of waiting millennia for proper mutations randomly popping up, use in-game GCAT-DNA editor (based on state of art very real software used by modern scientists all over the world), sequence the genome, lookup DNA amino-acid groups on Wikipedia and play god... even more! While at it - claim the creations as new species, fill the animal and plant almanac with new entries, and create a unique life-tree. For the science!

Search for weapons, supplies, ammunition and the most important resource of allâ€”fellow Survivors.<br>Instead of a major city or a sprawling countryside, the player must focus effort on building up a single structure, finding and training Survivors to battle zombies, and venturing out into town on missionsâ€¦all while the clock ticks steadily down toward zero hour, when an Apocalyptic wave of zombies from a neighboring city will crash over the town.<br><br>Targeted directly at the after-work gamer, Fort Zombie was the first debut of many game concepts and features that would be picked up and popularized in the games that followed afterward, including Day Z, Project Zomboid, Dead Rising, State of Decay.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Choose one of three buildings â€“ the school, the prison, and the police station â€“ as your Fort Zombie, each one with its own strengths and weaknesses!<br></li><li>Real time movement and combat keep the tensions level high while trying to achieve objectives before your characters run out of ammunition, food, or luck! <br></li><li>Dozens of zombie types, some with special abilities derived from their half-remembered lives before becoming undead! <br></li><li>Piety, Indiana, a variable 3D town, created using Kerberosâ€™ mix-and-match tile system, for maximum replayability. PhysXÂ® engine adds to the mayhem!<br></li><li>Dozens of town locations to search (stores, restaurants, gas stations, ruins, homes) and countless items to find and use in building up The Fort or building up your group characters (food, fuel, generators, tools, guns, etc.) <br></li><li>â€œCollectibleâ€ NPCâ€™s and Survivor families give players access to the Lore of the game, and unlock surprising new abilitiesâ€”try to find them all!</li></ul>",
