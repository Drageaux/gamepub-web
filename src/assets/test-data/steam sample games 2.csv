Experience our music-driven adventure and aim for the highest score! You can even use your own music to play the game (though beware, any high-beat tracks will potentially make the game far too difficult to clear!)<br><br>Let yourself be taken away by the rhythm of Rise, as this adventure takes you on a journey, aiming for the sky while the landscape is altered around you as the protagonist collects letters for his loved one. You will jump and move across the scenery in platforming style. Place the platforms in the direction you wish to travel and be ready for every beat will bring you closer to the sky and beyond. <br><br>Collect the letters to achieve the highest score. Memory can be troublesome sometimes, so collecting the letters is important to preserving these stories for his loved one, and making sure that others will learn from past experiences. <br><br>Although a game about war, there is no violence and no fighting â€“ no horrors are to be found. It will take you on a journey to discover a true light passing through dark times, unwavering and pure, guiding through the beauty of the human mind.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features / How to play</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Music-beat based Platformer<br></li><li>Choose what platform to use and where to use it, in order to progress and collect items<br></li><li>Use your own music to play the game in Arcade mode<br></li><li>Explore different scenery as it changes while youâ€™re climbing upwards</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Studio Message</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Aik (Wittawat Keawcharoen)<br></li><li>Chloe Bonnet<br></li><li>Matthieu Gueguen<br></li><li>Ciro Duran<br></li><li>Douglas Pennant<br></li><li>Simon Mann<br></li><li>Peter Stewart<br></li><li>Matthias Varlet<br></li><li>Emma Smith</li></ul><br>The game was built using the Luxe engine (an open source framework).

This rating will be given out of 3 stars; Steve can earn 0,1,2 or 3 stars. These stars in turn allow Steve to add upgrades to his abilities. <br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/656690/extras/Upgrades.png?t=1537888048"" ><br><br>As mentioned above; the better you do in the levels, the more upgrade points you will have to spend on upgrading Steve's abilities. <br><br>His abilities are:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Jump Number</strong> - Initially, Steve can only jump once, before landing. This can be upgraded all the way to triple jump! <br></li><li><strong>Gem Attraction Radius</strong> - When starting out, in order to collect the gems, you will need to hit the very centre of the gem; however, this upgrade creates a collection circle around the gems, making it soooo much easier to collect them. <br></li><li><strong>Hand Time</strong> - Remember when I said you can turn into a hand? You can only be the hand for a short amount of time. This upgrade, increases the number of seconds you can be the hand<br></li><li><strong>Health</strong> - Kind of obvious, but, I will explain anyway. You can add more starting health to Steve, taking him from 100% to 200%. Simple. <br></li><li><strong>Smash Radius</strong> - This is the area in which enemies can be killed by the Super Smash. The more you upgrade this one, the larger the the blast radius is, meaning more damage to more enemies, further away. </li></ul><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/656690/extras/Goal.png?t=1537888048"" ><br><br>Nice and simple.....SAVE THE WORLD!",https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/header.jpg?t=1503074031,"[{'id': 0, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_4573d56a1a834bb50ca1963375a9099b68667459.600x338.jpg?t=1503074031', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_4573d56a1a834bb50ca1963375a9099b68667459.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503074031'}, {'id': 1, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_a3257e6f046a71d7a5b43bdfa4b0fe7cb4dd614a.600x338.jpg?t=1503074031', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_a3257e6f046a71d7a5b43bdfa4b0fe7cb4dd614a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503074031'}, {'id': 2, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_0c0cd032a49a1d9f1ca3cc41efc930e1892c1d14.600x338.jpg?t=1503074031', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_0c0cd032a49a1d9f1ca3cc41efc930e1892c1d14.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503074031'}, {'id': 3, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_57045a50584d02c72943bc53f0a03f5df8d0a240.600x338.jpg?t=1503074031', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_57045a50584d02c72943bc53f0a03f5df8d0a240.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503074031'}, {'id': 4, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_a5d7d069709e7df08da448fe621b4a5067e1dd21.600x338.jpg?t=1503074031', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/657500/ss_a5d7d069709e7df08da448fe621b4a5067e1dd21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503074031'}]"

					<p>But it wasn't a viral outbreak. It was a parasitic infestation. A previously unidentified species of hook worm was found beneath the skin of the Ground: ALPHA specimens.
					These parasites, we call them ""Alpha-worms"", laid dozens of eggs inside their hosts, which in turn produced numerous larvae. These larvae penetrated the bloodstream and triggered a variety of genetic failures. However, unlike most genetic failures, these symptoms were not fatal. Instead, infested victims were larger, strongerâ€¦ and driven by hunger.

					<p>But it wasn't a viral outbreak. It was a parasitic infestation. A previously unidentified species of hook worm was found beneath the skin of the Ground: ALPHA specimens.
					These parasites, we call them ""Alpha-worms"", laid dozens of eggs inside their hosts, which in turn produced numerous larvae. These larvae penetrated the bloodstream and triggered a variety of genetic failures. However, unlike most genetic failures, these symptoms were not fatal. Instead, infested victims were larger, strongerâ€¦ and driven by hunger. 
					Using the research gained from the Ground: ALPHA specimens, a team of some special individuals were assembled. Minor outbreaks occurred over the next few years, but elite squad quickly put them down. Which brings us to the current situation in Tokyo...<p>

A WONDER is a student project made in 15 weeks.
It is the result of a 1-year program students enrolled at Le Campus ADN, in Montreal (Quebec), Canada. 

Le Campus ADN is a publicly-funded vocational school dedicated to video game development.
Every year, three groups are enroled in the programs the Campus delivers : Level design, 3D Modeling, and 3D Animation for games.
After learning the basics of their respective fields during the 2 first trimesters, they join forces during the third one to develop from design to test, a complete playable game.

The goal is to raise your town to make it safe (the longest you can). It features a day/night cycle system and monsters show up at night and may attack you. The number of enemies and their power increase as the days pass. <br />
<br />
There are 5 resources in Evertown (food, wood, iron, gold and glory). You get glory by building stuff and battling, and you can use it to buy upgrades for you town and levelling it up (unlocking NEW buildings and units)! Food is also really important in Evertown since your population consume it, and when there's no food on stocks, they starve to death. <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the game, you get to create your hero, and he is going to be very important for your village, since he gets stronger as he levels up. You get to be careful and try to keep him alive, so he won't lose too much experience points! <br />
<br />
The world is randomly generated with lakes, hills, pines, sand, etc and you need to adapt your gameplay based on where you've spawned. <br />
<br />
FEATURES: <br />
<br />
- AoE-like controls; <br />
- Awesome pixel art and animations; <br />
- Randomly generated world; <br />
- Lots of upgrades, units and buildings (more will be added); <br />
- Challenging difficulties; <br />
- Fun cheats to change player's experience a bit; <br />
- Instructions for units (defensive mode, follow, patrol, aggressive); <br />
- 30, 45, 60 or 80 FPS. <br />
<br />
The game is still in development, and it is not feature full, lots of things will still change (for the better, I promise). <br />
<br />
PLANNED FEATURES: <br />
<br />
- Bosses; <br />
- &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; mode; <br />
- More sound and visual effects (graphics revamp is coming); <br />
- Boats; <br />
- Map editor; <br />
- And much more!; <br />

However, that does not mean it is a typical rhythm game. Taking inspiration from some of the greatest classic games ever made, it's a high-octane hardcore rail shooter first and foremost that just so happens to build itself in front of your eyes from any music you play.<br />
<br />
Analyzing more audio components than any music-driven game before, Signal to Noise pieces together your experience based on the dynamics, pitch and tempo of your chosen track, interpreting it phrase-by-phrase and crafting your experience on the fly. Enemies, power-ups and the arenas themselves act differently each time you play a new tune. The game supports any audio file or playlist, and can even be played at live music events.<br />
<br />
Designed by passionate classic gamers, this game has what could be the strongest focus of any modern game on what made point-pressing and competitive high score play in classic arcade games so strategically deep and satisfying. With an understanding of this type of play unrivaled elsewhere in independent games, Signal to Noise has been designed for the players with the greatest understanding of the game and greatest skill to come out on top in the leaderboards. Even still, while competitive play and depth of mechanics is a great focus of the design, the game is fun for everyone that likes music and video games!<br />

Kingdoms also offers new multiplayer maps and hotseat multiplayer, a first for the Total War series, allowing you to play one-versus-one campaign games on the same computer.<br>					<ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Four new campaigns - Britannia, Teutonic, Crusades, and New World<br>					</li><li>10 new units<br>					</li><li>13 new factions<br>					</li><li>9 new agents<br>					</li><li>50 new buildings<br>					</li><li>60+ new territories across four new maps<br>					</li><li>15 new multiplayer maps and scenarios<br>					</li><li>All-new 1v1 hotseat multiplayer campaign mode</li></ul>",https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/header.jpg?t=1542726404,"[{'id': 0, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002596.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002596.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 1, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002597.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002597.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 2, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002598.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002598.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 3, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002599.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002599.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 4, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002600.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002600.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 5, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002601.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002601.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 6, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002602.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002602.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 7, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002603.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002603.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 8, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002604.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002604.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 9, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002605.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002605.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 10, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002606.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002606.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 11, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002607.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002607.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 12, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002608.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002608.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}, {'id': 13, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002609.600x338.jpg?t=1542726404', 'path_full': 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4780/0000002609.1920x1080.jpg?t=1542726404'}]"
